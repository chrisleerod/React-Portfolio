I started my academic career as a Pre-Med student, but fast-forward a couple of years, and I found my love for computer science and design.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>I find joy working on complex design problems, coding, exercising, playing sports and video games, and hanging with friends and family.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>I have always loved technology â€“ ever since I was able to use a computer. My joy for technology has led to my fascination with design and software. Being able to create products that help people is an amazing opportunity to make peoplesâ€™ lives easier.</p>

                                I started my freelance design company back in February 2018. I have worked with
                                sneaker software companies that help their users purchase limited releases (think Supreme, Yeezy,
                                Jordans, etc.) to create marketing animations, web/product design projects, and other cool
                                stuff. One of my marketing animations has over 180,000,000 interactions on Twitter. Check that business out <a className="here" href="https://twitter.com/imagecrate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
